		"and I will be the mastermind of it all. LOL. I love you so much and you mean so much to me genuinely. You mean the absolute world to me. I cannot wait till we are together and we get " +
		"to do mundane-everyday things together. You make my everyday so happy and so worth it. You have such a warm spark and I just want to be around it all the time. You are my home and I know " +
		"I say that a lot but its because of how true it is. You deserve everything in the world and so much more. I can only hope that I make you feel the love I have for you. You never fail to make " +
		"me smile. I am the most luckiest girl in the world for having the most amazing girlfriend. Malaika, you are genuinely one of a kind in the best way possible. You stick with me through all " +
		"my ups and downs. You love me in the gentle-est of ways. You heal parts of me I didn't even realize needed healing. You help me be a better person everyday and you make me feel so special " +
		"and important. Your gift you sent me this year was was the greated gifts I ever recieved. Not only because they were from you but also because you made me feel seen. I don't think I had ever felt " +
		"so seen. You make me feel like the most treasured person in the world. As long as I have you by my side I feel like I can conquer anything. You are so beautiful, inside and out. I can't believe " +
		"how lucky I am to have such an amazing person like you in my life. I can only hope through my efforts that I can make you feel as loved, seen, valued, admired, adored as you make me. You make " +
		"love feel so easy. The way you make me smile and laugh without trying. How comfortable you make me. I feel like a little kid again. You are the person I want by my side forever and ever and ever. " +
		"You've come so far being 21 and all and I could NOT be more proud of you. I can't wait to see you come May and shower you in so much love and affection. No matter whether you're working or we do stuff " +
		"what matters to me is that we are together. Being able to see you, hold you, and cherish you in person is more than enough for me. All this to say, I hope you don't overthink or worry that you're going " +
		"to potentially be working while I am there because I promise you I do not mind. Being able to do stuff for you and be next to you is all that I ask for. You are such an admirable person. " +
		"you deserve so much in your life and being able to be a part of your life is such a blessing. " +
		"I should thank Amanda, to be honest. Meeting the love of my life was all thanks to her server. LOL. I love you so much and everything about you. Your weirdness, your beauty, your ability to match my freak. " +
		"I love your voice and your laugh. I said that from the first time we met and that's something I will stand by till the day I die. Your eyes hold my whole world. Your beauty as a whole captivates me " +
		"and everytime I look at you I can feel my eyes turn into hearts. Just thinking about you fills me with so much warmth. I can feel the fireworks exploding in my heart from your tender words. Your " +
		"accepting-ness and understanding for me is something I may never understand. How receptive you are when I tell you things and your willingness to listen to me, it all means so much to me. Again " +
		"healing parts of me I never even realized needed healing. My love for you goes beyond words on a page (or ig screen) and beyond what is tangible in this universe. Never in a million years could " +
		"even the strongest of gods quantify the love I have for you. There are times I stay up just thinking about how much I love you and how I wish I could express all the love I have for you. As of " +
		"now I can only hope that you believe me when I say, I would do anything for you. I would take a bullet for you. I would jump in front of a train for you. I would jump off a cliff for you. I would "+
		"watch someone throw up in front of me for you. BOOM! That's such a big thing you should know heh. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for saying it's easy to love me. Thank you for all the " +
		"time you give me. You put up with so much of a bullshit and never give up on me. Your desire to understand me as well makes me feel so appreciative and grateful. I've never had someone express "+
		"any of that to me and I am so glad that it's you. I love you so much, my lady of the moon. Happy Birthday, once again, my seal, turtle, mike, baby, mommy, love, wife, cat, sweetheart, jagi, love of my " +
